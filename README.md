# WGU C868 - Software Development Capstone

## Sure Smiles, Inc. Scheduling System

Sure Smiles Inc., a local dental office, is looking to upgrade its aging appointment scheduling and
reporting system for its dental patients. The dental office assistants use a third-party appointment scheduling system
riddled with bugs due to the application vendor no longer offering support for future maintenance and upgrades. The
current system also does not have a reporting feature, which the practice owner has been seeking for a long time due to
the inaccuracy of manually written reports. The practice owner would like to ensure that the migration goes off without a
hitch. Ultimately, the goal will be for this new application to replace the legacy appointment scheduling and reporting
system and be able to carry over their current patient information. The practice owner is also thinking about opening a
second practice to expand his business and cannot have a faulty system while planning this expansion. After much
discussion about the frustration of using their current system, the practice owner has decided that a new appointment
scheduling and reporting system was in order.

The purpose of this capstone project is to create an administrative desktop application for a
local dental office, Sure Smiles Inc., which will include adding and managing customers and appointments as well as having
the ability to run reports by total customers per month, scheduled appointments, and a visual pie chart depicting the total
number of customers by country to where the practice will operate. The application will also have login functionality that
will require a username and password verified by the credentials stored in a database.
